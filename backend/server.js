My Analysis:
1. First, I need to identify what our refund policy is for annual subscriptions.
2. For annual subscriptions, we offer prorated refunds based on the unused portion of the subscription.
3. The calculation would be: (Original annual payment) × (Months remaining ÷ 12)
4. For example, if you paid $300 for an annual plan and used it for 3 months, the refund would be $300 × (9 ÷ 12) = $225.
5. There may be additional considerations like any discounts that were applied to the annual subscription.

Based on our refund policy, if you cancel an annual subscription before it's complete, you're eligible for a prorated refund for the unused months. The refund amount is calculated based on the original payment and the number of months remaining in your subscription period.

To process this refund, I'll need:
1. Your account email address
2. The date you purchased the annual subscription
3. Confirmation that you want to cancel the subscription entirely

Once you provide this information, I can calculate the exact refund amount and help you process the cancellation and refund. Would you like to proceed with this?`;

My Analysis:
1. First, I need to determine which plan you're currently on and which plan you're upgrading to.
2. Let's assume you're upgrading from Basic ($10/month) to Pro ($30/month).
3. When upgrading, we prorate the cost based on the days remaining in your billing cycle.
4. For example, if you have 15 days left in a 30-day billing cycle, you'd pay for 15/30 = 0.5 of the price difference.
5. The price difference between Basic and Pro is $30 - $10 = $20.
6. So the prorated upgrade cost would be $20 × 0.5 = $10 for the remainder of the current billing cycle.
7. Then your next bill would be the full $30 for the Pro plan.

When you upgrade your subscription, we calculate a prorated charge for the remainder of your current billing cycle. This means you only pay the difference between your current plan and the new plan for the days remaining in your billing period.

For example, if you're halfway through your billing cycle when upgrading from Basic to Pro, you'd pay approximately $10 extra for the upgrade (half the monthly difference between the plans). Then, your next regular billing would be for the full Pro plan price of $30/month.

Would you like me to calculate the exact cost for your specific situation? I'd need to know your current plan, the plan you want to upgrade to, and how many days are left in your current billing cycle.`;
  } else {
    return `Thank you for your billing question. Let me think through this carefully to provide you with the most helpful response.

My Analysis:
1. Based on your query, I understand you're asking about a billing-related issue.
2. Without specific details, I need to consider what general information would be most helpful.
3. The most common billing questions relate to subscription charges, refunds, or plan changes.
4. I should provide general information about our billing policies while asking for more specifics.
5. This will allow me to give more tailored assistance once I have more details.

I'd be happy to help with your billing question, but I'll need a few more details to provide the most accurate information. Our billing system handles several types of transactions including monthly and annual subscriptions, one-time purchases, and various plan levels (Basic at $10/month, Pro at $30/month, and Enterprise at $100/month).

Could you please provide more specific information about your question? For example:
- Are you inquiring about a specific charge on your account?
- Do you have questions about upgrading or downgrading your subscription?
- Are you looking for information about our refund policy?
- Is this regarding a payment method update?

Once you provide these details, I can give you a much more specific and helpful answer.`;
